# Description

This project follows a structured Git workflow implemented using IntelliJ IDEA. The process involved initializing the repository, setting up a GitHub project board to manage tasks, and creating issues for five test cases. Each test case was fixed in a separate branch, solving the problem, making pull requests, and merging into the main. The whole process was tracked on the project board to update work progress, enabling a very organized and systematic workflow.
